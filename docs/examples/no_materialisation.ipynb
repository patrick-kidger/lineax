    "# Using only matrix-vector operations\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving a linear system $Ax = b$, it is relatively common not to have immediate access to the full matrix $A$, but only to a function $F(x) = Ax$ computing the matrix-vector product. (We could compute $A$ from $F$, but is the matrix is large then this may be very inefficient.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Newton's method**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this comes up when using [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method#k_variables,_k_functions). In this case, we have a function $f \\colon \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$, and wish to find the $\\delta \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ for which $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}y}(y) \\; \\delta = -f(y)$. (Where $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}y}(y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a matrix: it is the Jacobian of $f$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case it is possible to use forward-mode autodifferentiation to evaluate $F(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}y}(y) \\; x$, without ever instantiating the whole Jacobian $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}y}(y)$. Indeed, JAX has a [Jacobian-vector product function](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.jvp.html#jax.jvp) for exactly this purpose.\n",

    "    Note that iterative solvers are something of a \"last resort\", and they are not suitable for all problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [CG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method) requires that the problem be positive or negative semidefinite.\n",
    "    - Normalised CG (this is CG applied to the \"normal equations\" $(A^\\top A) x = (A^\\top b)$; note that $A^\\top A$ is always positive semidefinite) squares the condition number of $A$. In practice this means it may produce low-accuracy results if used with matrices with high condition number.\n",
    "    - [BiCGStab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconjugate_gradient_stabilized_method) and [GMRES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_minimal_residual_method) will fail on many problems. They are primarily meant as specialised tools for e.g. the matrices that arise when solving elliptic systems."
