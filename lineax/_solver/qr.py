    This solver can handle non-square operators.

    This is usually the preferred solver when dealing with non-square operators.

    !!! info

        Note that whilst this does handle non-square operators, it still can only
        handle full-rank operators.

        This is because JAX does not currently support a rank-revealing/pivoted QR
        decomposition, see [issue #12897](https://github.com/google/jax/issues/12897).

        For such use cases, switch to [`lineax.SVD`][] instead.
