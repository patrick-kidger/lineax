- `well_posed`: if `False`, then singular operators are accepted, and the pseudoinverse
    solution is returned. If `True` then passing a singular operator will cause an error

- `rcond`: the cutoff for handling zero entries on the diagonal. Defaults to machine
    precision times `N`, where `N` is the input (or output) size of the operator.
